# What is Fizz Buzz and why did I write this

* Fizz Buzz, as the first JavaScript window indicates, is a children's game used to teach multiplcation. 

* Because there are more than a few ways to accomplish this task, the methods by which the programmer completes the task are instructive for getting a sense of his capabilities, so the rationale goes.

* I started writing this to just give it a go, but as I learned new things, I just sort of added onto it.
