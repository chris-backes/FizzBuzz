# What is Fizz Buzz and why did I write this

* Fizz Buzz, as the first JavaScript window indicates, is a children's game used to teach multiplcation. As far as I can tell, it is only really all that common in the UK/Britain.

* At one point, it was common, at least on that side of the pond, to prompt a prospective employee during an interview to write code that would accomplish that. (In coding contexts, it is referred to as FizzBuzz)

* Becasue there are more than a few ways to accomplish this task, the methods by which the programmer completes the task are instructive for getting a sense of his capabilities, so the rationale goes.

* I started writing this to just give it a go, but as I learned new things, I just sort of added onto it.
